This project is to put together a simple image classification pipeline to classify hand-written digit 0 and 1, based on the logistic regression or the SVM classifier.

To implement and solve linear Logistic Regression model and Linear SVM model (without regularization term) on MNIST dataset. In this task, I only perform binary classification on digit 0 and 1. The code start from data loading and iterations of training data. The training is done using PyTorch. The model is optimize  by using SGD and Momentum methods.
